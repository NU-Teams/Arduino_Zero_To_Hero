# :printer: 3D Printing Zero-to-Hero

<video controls src="../assets/3D PRINTING ZERO TO HERO/Welcome to 3D Printing Zero-to-Hero!.mp4"></video>

3D Printing is a revolutionary manufacturing technology that enables the production of complex, custom, and precise objects from digital 3D models. This manufacturing process is incredibly versatile and accessible, and is revolutionising industries ranging from healthcare to aerospace. 

3D printing is also a cornerstone of the emerging maker culture, democratising manufacturing, as it is now easier than ever to turn a concept into a physical part right from your home.

NU Teams extensively leverages 3D printing as a prototyping and manufacturing tool. From mounting sensors, to building electrical enclosures, to printing prototypes for test assemblies, 3D printing is probably our most-utilised manufacturing process.

## Learning Outcomes

In this short course, you'll learn about:

- [x] STLs and CAD export settings,

- [x] Slicing software and settings including:

    * [x] Layer Height,

    * [x] Orientation and supports,

    * [x] Shell thickness and infill.

- [x] Permanently joining your prints through glueing and welding,

- [x] Temporarily joining your prints using fasteners,

- [x] Designing tolerances for printed parts,

- [x] CAD principles for printed parts.
