# :house: Welcome!

NU Teams has constructed bespoke training modules to aid you in your projects.

These modules will cover information outside/above/in addition to core courses, with a focus on  'hands-on' topics.

Modules will typically consist of:

~2-hours of video content, segmented into small (~5 minute) chunks.

Accompanying written resource pages for each video with links to bonus content.

Physical/hands-on exercises/problems to complete between videos, and/or

A module 'capstone' project.

Some modules will be required 'reading' for ENGG2200 Induction Projects. Others will simply be helpful resources to support you in your efforts.

## Microcredentials
When you complete a NU Teams training module, contact Dylan Cuskelly or Malcolm Sidney for assessment of your module capstone project. Once assessed, you will be certified, recognised, and awarded a completion certificate and badge to add to your team shirt.
