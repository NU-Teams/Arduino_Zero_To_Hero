This manufacturing process is incredibly versatile and accessible, and is revolutionising industries ranging from healthcare to aerospace. </p> <p>3D printing is also a cornerstone of the emerging maker culture, democratising manufacturing, as it is now easier than ever to turn a concept into a physical part right from your home.</p> <p>NU Teams extensively leverages 3D printing as a prototyping and manufacturing tool. From mounting sensors, to building electrical enclosures, to printing prototypes for test assemblies, 3D printing is probably our most-utilised manufacturing process.</p>"},{"location":"3DPZTH-Intro/#learning-outcomes","title":"Learning Outcomes","text":"<p>In this short course, you'll learn about:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Printer hardware and the workings of a printer,</p> </li> <li> <p> STLs and CAD export settings,</p> </li> <li> <p> Slicing software and settings including:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Layer Height,</p> </li> <li> <p> Orientation and supports,</p> </li> <li> <p> Shell thickness and infill.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> Permanently joining your prints through glueing and welding,</p> </li> <li> <p> Temporarily joining your prints using fasteners,</p> </li> <li> <p> Designing tolerances for printed parts,</p> </li> <li> <p> CAD principles for printed parts.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"3DPZTH-Intro/#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p> Resource:</p> <p>This module was not created in a vacuum.
